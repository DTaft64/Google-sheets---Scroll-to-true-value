# notOnOpen() Script

## Overview

This Google Apps Script scans the “Stocks & Flows” sheet in a Google Sheet, searches column G for the first TRUE value, and scrolls the active view to that cell, positioning it near the top of the screen.

## Maintenance

To adapt this script to your specific use case, modify the following variables in the code:

1. Sheet Name

Update the name of the sheet to match your sheet name:

var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName("Stocks & Flows");

2. Target Column

Set the column to search by updating the column index. For example, 7 corresponds to column G:

var columnG = sheet.getRange(1, 7, lastRow).getValues(); // 7 = Column G

3. Row Offset

Change the +23 offset to adjust how far down the matched row appears on the screen:

var targetRow = Math.min(lastRow, i + 23);

## How to Use
	1.	Add this script to your Google Sheet:
	•	Go to Extensions > Apps Script.
	•	Paste the script into the editor.
	•	Save the script.
	2.	Run the notOnOpen() function from the Apps Script editor or create a trigger to automate it.
	3.	The script will:
	•	Locate the first TRUE in the specified column.
	•	Scroll the sheet so the matched row appears near the top of the screen.
	•	Stop searching after finding the first match.

## Troubleshooting
	•	Sheet Not Found: Ensure the sheet name matches the value set in the script.
	•	No Effect: Verify that the target column contains TRUE values.
	•	Errors: Confirm that the column index and data range are correctly defined.
